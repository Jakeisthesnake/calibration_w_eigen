Todo
- Visualize 3d data from 3 cameras
    - load intrinsics and extrinsics DONE
    - load data and target           DONE?
    - project target onto data using int/ext DONE?
    - Make Frame_data (detected points + timestamp) from loaded points and feed into vizualization DONE
    - Build poses? DONE
    - Make sure all the input args for the vizualization of calculated in main DONE
    - modify vizulaizer to allow on screen modification of int/ext while updating error and vizuals DONE (needs error)
    - Check 
- Generate perfect synthetic 3d data DONE?
- Get frames and timestamps to sync up DONE?
- Check vizualized tranforms based on what the data waht gereated with
- get very low error initializing with intrinsics used to generate data
- get low error initializing close, but not exactly the intriniscs used to gerenate data
- gererate synthetic data 3d data with noise
- get reasonable error initializing with intrinsics used to generate data
- get reasonable error initializing close, but not exactly the intriniscs used to gerenate data
